      <h2>About hyprZona <span class="arrow">▼</span></h2>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Our Journey</h3>
        <p>hyprZona was born from a passion for storytelling and a dream to become a household name in entertainment. Our journey began with a simple Discord bot, which, despite its initial success, faced unexpected challenges. This setback, however, only fueled our determination to create something even more impactful.</p>
        
        <h3>The Spark</h3>
        <p>The true catalyst for hyprZona came from an unexpected source - a notebook filled with stories. When a classmate, now a dear friend, recognized the potential in these tales, it ignited a vision. This led to the revival and reimagining of "The T'N'T: Prologue," transforming it from a planned graphic novel into an expanded, darker eBook - marking our first step into the world of digital publishing.</p>
        
        <h3>Expanding Horizons</h3>
        <p>Our ambition didn't stop at eBooks. The desire to bring interactive stories to life led us to game development. Despite initial hardware limitations, the discovery of the Godot engine opened new possibilities. Our debut game, born from a short story and developed alongside academic pursuits, became a journey of learning and growth in game design and programming.</p>
        
        <h3>Vision and Future</h3>
        <p>At hyprZona, we're committed to continuous improvement and expansion. Each project is a stepping stone, teaching us valuable lessons that we apply to our next endeavor. Our goal is to create immersive, thought-provoking content across various media, including but not limited to games and eBooks. As we grow, we aim to venture into broader aspects of technology, always with our core value of storytelling at heart.</p>
        
        <h3>Join Our Journey</h3>
        <p>We invite you to be part of the hyprZona story. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we continue to evolve and bring new, exciting experiences to our audience. Thank you for being here at the start of what we believe will be an extraordinary adventure in digital entertainment.</p>

    <section class="expandable-section about-founder">
      <h2>Meet the Founder <span class="arrow">▼</span></h2>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Hey there, I'm D.M.!</h3>
        <p>First off, I'm a <span id="age"></span>-year-old guy from India with a head full of dreams and a heart full of stories. Oh, and I'm proudly straight and atheist (wink wink, nudge nudge).</p>
        
        <h3>The Shy Guy's Not-So-Shy Side</h3>
        <p>Okay, let's get this out of the way - I'm what you'd call an ambivert. Sure, I might be a bit scared of talking to strangers (who isn't?), but get me started on my passions, and you won't be able to shut me up!</p>
        
        <h3>Jack of All Trades, Master of... Well, Working On It!</h3>
        <p>Sports? Nah, not my thing. But creativity? Oh boy, that's where I shine! I'm not just about stories and game dev (though those are pretty awesome). I'm also a programming enthusiast - give me some complicated functions, and I'm in nerd heaven.</p>
        
        <h3>A World of Imagination</h3>
        <p>Self-centered? Nope. Lost in my own world? Absolutely! I've got enough ideas bouncing around in my head to last a lifetime. Who needs reality when you've got imagination, right?</p>
        
        <h3>The Musical Side</h3>
        <p>Did I mention I'm a bit of a musician too? Yep, I can tickle the ivories and strum a guitar. In fact, I've even composed three tunes for my game. And hey, keep an ear out for "Fading Ashes" - that's my solo project where I'm channeling my inner Chester Bennington (Linkin Park forever!).</p>
        
        <h3>Academic Rollercoaster</h3>
        <p>Academically? Well, let's just say I'm on a bit of a... scenic route. But who knows? Maybe there's a comeback story brewing. Stay tuned!</p>
        
        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe I'll drop a single soon, or maybe I'll create the next big game. Or maybe I'll just keep daydreaming in class. Whatever happens, it's bound to be an adventure!</p>
        
        <p>That's all for now, folks. Catch you on the flip side!</p>
