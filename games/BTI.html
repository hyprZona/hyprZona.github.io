        <h2>Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>It was supposed to be a day of hope and reconciliation, but when heartbreak shatters his world, a teenage boy finds himself spiraling into a mysterious forest where reality twists into something far more sinister. What begins as a simple escape from the pain of lost love transforms into a desperate fight for survival as he awakens in a darker, unfamiliar version of the forest—his memories scattered and his only way out buried in fragments of his past.

Each memory he uncovers draws him closer to the truth behind his breakup, but the forest grows more dangerous with every step. Shadows stalk his every move, and sinister forces wait in the depths, eager to ensnare him. With choices shaping his fate, survival depends on his wits, reflexes, and determination to escape the horrors that blur the line between reality and nightmare.

But even if he escapes the forest, will the truth set him free... or lead him to something far worse?

Every decision matters in this psychological survival adventure. In the end, one truth will remain: <i>there’s no escaping your past.</i></p>

                    <h3>When Nightmares Turn Into Games</h3>
                    <p>So, <i>Beyond the Illusions</i> wasn’t meant to be a big deal at first. It was just something to help with my college application and an excuse to learn Godot. The story? Oh, that came from a nightmare. Yep, I just picked that weird dream and ran with it, tweaking things along the way to make a small game. Funny how something random like that turned into my first <i>actual</i> project, right?</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <h3>Breakups Make Great Story Fuel</h3>
                    <p>Here’s the thing: the protagonist’s story is <i>kind</i> of my story. After a breakup (ugh), I had this moment resting by a hill near my house, processing everything. That eventually made its way into the game. Nothing fancy or planned—I just started coding and modeling straight from my head. Sure, it’s not the deepest story out there, but it’s real, and it meant something to me.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <h3>Maze? Nah, Let’s Go With Memories</h3>
                    <p>Originally, there was supposed to be this maze in the forest part of the game. But then I thought, “Hmm, what if I did something more personal?” That’s when the memory fragments idea came in. The maze was cool, but it didn’t fit the breakup story, so I scrapped it and switched gears. It’s wild how ideas can evolve mid-development, but hey, that’s game dev for you.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>Potato PCs and Creative Compromises</h3>
                    <p>Godot is awesome, but being a first-timer with a not-so-great laptop? Pain. I had all these cool plans—procedural mazes, crazy illusions—but my laptop was like, “Nope.” The game’s debug window sometimes wouldn’t even load properly. I had to make the game simpler, switch to lower-quality models, and cut some big ideas. Fun fact: that bug where trees randomly spawn when you land in the forest? Totally unplanned, but it added to the vibe, so I kept it. Who says bugs can’t be happy accidents?</p>

                    <h3>Memories Took Forever (But Worth It)</h3>
                    <p>The memory fragments part? Oh boy, that was the time sink—15 hours of pure grind. As a gamer, I didn’t want it to just be a boring walking sim with spooky vibes. So, I went all in on puzzles, obstacles, and, you know, something engaging. Sure, there are still bugs (I see you, overlapping trees), but hey, it’s my first game! Gotta start somewhere, right?</p>

                    <h3>Lava River Parkour = Pure Chaos</h3>
                    <p>Let’s talk about the lava river part. This was hands down the most exciting section to work on. Making those rocks spawn in different places every time? So much fun. Yeah, it’s long, but come on, it’s supposed to be a challenge! Watching the system come together without breaking was honestly such a win.</p>

                    <h3>Testing? Just Me, Myself, and I</h3>
                    <p>I asked a few friends to test the game early on, but by the end, it was mostly me. Why? Well, I wasn’t paying anyone, so I had to roll up my sleeves and figure it out myself. Honestly, it worked out—I’ve played enough horror games to know what’s fun and what’s <i>meh</i>.</p>

                    <h3>Plans Changed. A Lot.</h3>
                    <p>Let me be real: nothing in this game turned out as I originally planned. Most of the mechanics were last-minute ideas or came from realizing, <i>“Okay, that’s too hard to code right now.”</i> Some were inspired by other games I played, and some just happened because of technical limits. It was basically a giant experiment, and I kinda loved that.</p>

                    <h3>That Sweet, Sweet Finish Line</h3>
                    <p>Finally finishing the game was such a mix of emotions—relief, excitement, maybe a little bit of “Ah, it’s over.” From May 25 to September 4, it was just learning, debugging, and tweaking. Sure, the game isn’t perfect, but it’s mine. My <i>first</i> game. And that’s something special, no matter how rough it might feel looking back.</p>

                    <p>This game taught me a <i>ton</i>. I know now what works, what doesn’t, and what I want to focus on in the future. Realism? Definitely stepping that up. Earth settings? Someday, for sure (when I can model humans without them looking like potatoes). But for now, the next game is already in the works, and it’s gonna be bigger and better.</p>

                    <p>This is just the beginning. <i>Beyond the Illusions</i> was my first step, and the next game? It’s gonna bring some real magic to the table. Stay tuned—you’re not gonna want to miss what’s coming next!</p>
