        <p>What started as a sweet little “Memories Demo” spiraled into my personal psychological hellscape. The whole story? Yeah, it's actually based on a post-breakup nightmare. So if any of it feels nonsensical, now you know—trauma writes the script.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: the orb segment was originally a full-on maze. But the logic was so cursed it fried my brain harder than when a <strike>bitch barks in my ears</strike> baby goes ham on a pacifier.</p>

        <p>I hit peak boredom. Procrastinated like a goddamn pro. Modeling and coding became torture. I ended up cutting a boss fight and scrapping two whole levels after the “void” sequence. Instead, I slapped on a copyrighted ghost image and tacked a post-credits scene that links to extra lore on my site—to <strike>calm my nerves</strike> keep that sweet ambiguity alive.</p>

        <p>Thought this would take, what, 10 to 20 hours max? Ha. The base game? Done in 10. But debugging? Raging over a missing semicolon? And oh—burning my hand to hell on my “extremely hot” <strike>big, fat hoe chocobar</strike> cup of coffee? That’s what really took me out. Yes, it happened during dev time. Yes, it counts. Shut up.</p>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">I</span>
                        <p>Long ago, in a time when the world bled ignorance and fear, there was a being—neither man nor beast, neither living nor dead. It had no body, no arms to hold nor legs to walk. Only a face—white, smooth, and void of emotion. This entity, known only as Ghostface, was a prodigy of deception, a whisperer of madness, a craftsman of manipulation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">II</span>
                        <p>But for all its cunning, Ghostface was incomplete. It could not take human form, could not taste suffering the way humans did. It could only watch from the abyss, envious of the creatures it sought to rule. And so, from the depths of its endless existence, it created them.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">III</span>
                        <p>Six monsters, sculpted from the shadows of despair and stitched together with lies. Each one a masterpiece of deception, a puppet of Ghostface’s will. They bore no names, for names were for the living. Instead, they were simply The Six, bound by a single purpose: to find a worthy human—not just any, but one who had lived through every emotion in its purest, rawest form.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">IV</span>
                        <p>The lake was their bait. It did not exist on any map, and no traveler ever remembered how they had found it. Its waters were still, reflecting the sky like a frozen mirror—silent, unassuming, yet waiting. Those who wandered too close felt an unsettling pull, as if something unseen had reached into their very soul.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">V</span>
                        <p>And when the chosen one arrived—the human strong enough, pure enough, worthy enough—fate would strike. A rock, as if hurled by an unseen hand, would crash into their skull. Not enough to kill, just enough to disorient. They would stumble, their balance lost. And then the lake, still as death, would swallow them whole.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">VI</span>
                        <p>Drowning never came. Instead, the victim awoke in The Territory of the Lost and Damned, a world that mocked reality yet obeyed no laws of it. Here, shadows moved without light. The wind whispered things in voices too familiar. The victim would feel disoriented, broken, but never truly afraid—not yet.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">VII</span>
                        <p>Their memories would be shattered, scattered into pieces—fragments of a past they could no longer grasp. And then, they would see them. The orbs. Faint, glowing, floating through the void. They must be collected—a natural instinct, a silent command burned into their mind. Each orb returned a sliver of memory, but something was wrong.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">VIII</span>
                        <p>The past felt… altered. The horrors they had witnessed, the suffering they had endured—softened, warped, stripped of their weight. Their pain became fiction, their reality a dream. Escape? Unnecessary. Nothing had ever happened. And if they took too long? If doubt whispered in their mind?</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">IX</span>
                        <p>The Six would begin to appear. At first, as nothing but figures in the distance, watching. Then, as whispers in the dark. Then, closer. If the victim strayed too far from the path, the illusion would shatter, and the purgatory would collapse upon them. Then, they would awaken again. By the lake. Whole. Safe. Unharmed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">X</span>
                        <p>And they would believe—without a doubt—that it had all been a dream. But the pull would remain. The lake would still call to them. And the next time they returned, they would not escape. If the victim entered the cave, the deception would end.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XI</span>
                        <p>The alley stretched long, longer than it should. The deeper they walked, the more the walls seemed to breathe. Shadows twisted unnaturally, whispering in a language that had no words. The air grew thick, damp, suffocating with a scent not of earth, but of rot. And then, at last, they would see it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XII</span>
                        <p>The cauldron. Massive, iron-clad, covered in symbols that pulsed with sickly light. The air shimmered above it, thick with heat. Inside, something writhed—a bubbling, seething blend of past victims—flesh melted into liquid, their essence still trapped, still screaming.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XIII</span>
                        <p>The Six would stand in a circle, motionless, waiting. Then, the voice would come. Not from the cave. Not from the monsters. But from behind them. Ghostface. White. Expressionless. Watching. No words were needed. The Six knew what was required. The victim, dazed, confused, unable to understand the horror unfolding before them—would be taken.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XIV</span>
                        <p>Held down. Arms. Legs. Chopped. First, the brain. Squeezed of its fluids, drained into the cauldron, the thick secretion turning the liquid into something more. The brain itself, crushed, broken apart, swallowed by the roiling mass. Then, the rest. Every piece of the victim’s body would be stripped away, layer by layer, until nothing but a memory remained.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XV</span>
                        <p>And in that moment, Ghostface would grow stronger. The Six, once beasts, would begin to change. Flesh stretching, twisting, warping into human forms—imperfect at first, but better with each sacrifice. They would learn to mimic emotion, to deceive perfectly, to infiltrate the world Ghostface could never touch.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XVI</span>
                        <p>Even if, by some impossible chance, the victim escaped the cave, fled back to their reality, they would never be free. Ghostface was patient. The Six were relentless. The moment they neared the lake again, they would be taken. Harder. Faster. With no mercy.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter">
                        <span class="chapter-number">XVII</span>
                        <p>And this time, when the stone struck them, when the water pulled them under, there would be no more dreams. No more illusions. No more escape. Only the cave. And the cauldron. And the whisper of Ghostface, forever watching, forever waiting.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="folklore-warning">
                        <p>Beware the lake that calls your name. Ghostface is watching. And The Six are waiting.</p>
